Detailed implementation plan based on the Problem Solving Studio (PSS) and pair programming approach described in the paper, adapted for our C programming lab syllabus:

# Implementation Plan for PSS-Based C Programming Lab

![over all](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9059ea-d778-41a9-b807-5bfaaa13b91b)

## Key Takeaways from the Paper
1. PSS combines with pair programming through:
   - Weekly structure: Demo → PSS Session → Debrief
   - Problem ladder approach with increasing difficulty
   - Dynamic scaffolding to adjust problem complexity
   - Real-time feedback through desk crits
   - Pair roles: Driver (writing code) and Navigator (reviewing/researching)

## 15-Week Implementation Structure

## Implementation Guidelines


![pss implementation guidelines](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d319ffa-36f5-4a5b-bbec-48c12e36002c)

### 1. Classroom Setup
```md
- Arrange computers in pairs
- Ensure each pair can see instructor's screen
- Maintain space for instructor to move between pairs
```

### 2. Pair Programming Rules
```md
- Switch roles every 25 minutes
- Driver: Writes code
- Navigator: Reviews, researches, suggests improvements
- Both must understand the code
```

### 3. Assessment Structure
```md
- Weekly mini-assessments (15%)
- Pair programming participation (15%)
- Individual coding exercises (30%)
- Final project (40%)
```

### 4. Dynamic Scaffolding Implementation
```md
Instructor Should:
1. Prepare 3 difficulty levels for each topic
2. Have ready-made hints for common obstacles
3. Monitor pair progress actively
4. Adjust problem complexity in real-time
```

This implementation plan adapts the paper's PSS approach to your specific C programming syllabus while maintaining the core benefits of pair programming and problem-solving studio methodologies.
