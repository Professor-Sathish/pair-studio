Detailed implementation plan based on the Problem Solving Studio (PSS) and pair programming approach described in the paper, adapted for our C programming lab syllabus:

# Implementation Plan for PSS-Based C Programming Lab

## Key Takeaways from the Paper
1. PSS combines with pair programming through:
   - Weekly structure: Demo → PSS Session → Debrief
   - Problem ladder approach with increasing difficulty
   - Dynamic scaffolding to adjust problem complexity
   - Real-time feedback through desk crits
   - Pair roles: Driver (writing code) and Navigator (reviewing/researching)

## 15-Week Implementation Structure

### Week 1-3: Unit I (Basics of C Programming)
```md
Structure per Week:
1. First Session: Instructor Demo (50 mins)
   - Live coding demonstration of basic concepts
   - Interactive Q&A
   
2. Second Session: PSS (50 mins)
   - Problem Ladder Example:
     Level 1: Simple calculator operations
     Level 2: Temperature conversion with validation
     Level 3: Complex mathematical series
   
3. Third Session: Debrief/Review (50 mins)
   - Instructor solves Level 2 problem
   - Reviews different approaches
   - Common pitfalls discussion
```

### Week 4-6: Unit II (Arrays and Strings)
```md
Sample Problem Ladder:
1. Basic: Array operations (sum, average)
2. Intermediate: Matrix operations
3. Advanced: String manipulation combining arrays
```

### Week 7-9: Unit III (Functions and Pointers)
```md
Focus Areas:
- Function implementation with pair switching
- Pointer visualization exercises
- Memory management challenges
```

### Week 10-12: Unit IV (Structures and Unions)
```md
Implementation:
- Start with simple structure problems
- Build to linked list implementations
- Culminate in mini-project work
```

### Week 13-15: Unit V (File Processing)
```md
Final Project Integration:
- File-based applications
- Complete system implementation
- Team presentations
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Classroom Setup
```md
- Arrange computers in pairs
- Ensure each pair can see instructor's screen
- Maintain space for instructor to move between pairs
```

### 2. Pair Programming Rules
```md
- Switch roles every 25 minutes
- Driver: Writes code
- Navigator: Reviews, researches, suggests improvements
- Both must understand the code
```

### 3. Assessment Structure
```md
- Weekly mini-assessments (15%)
- Pair programming participation (15%)
- Individual coding exercises (30%)
- Final project (40%)
```

### 4. Dynamic Scaffolding Implementation
```md
Instructor Should:
1. Prepare 3 difficulty levels for each topic
2. Have ready-made hints for common obstacles
3. Monitor pair progress actively
4. Adjust problem complexity in real-time
```
